# Title

Auto Scaler for inference workloads in Kaito

## Summary

As the number of waiting inference requests increases, it is necessary to scale more inference instances in order to prevent blocking inference requests. On the other hand, if the number of waiting inference requests declines, we should consider reducing inference instances to improve GPU resource utilization.
Native Kubernetes has provided HPA capability to scale workload instances automatically as the metrics change, but HPA depends on third-party components (like Prometheus, Prometheus Adapter, etc.) to collect custom metrics from the source pods.

In this proposal, we hope to support a customized auto-scaler which is specialized for scaling GPU workloads for Kaito. The auto-scaler is designed for a minimalistic configuration experience, with most parameters pre-tuned for optimal performance. This allows users to easily get started without requiring specialized knowledge of LLM.

## Motivation

LLM inference service is a basic and widely-used feature in Kaito, and Kaito community interest in auto-scaler for inference workloads continues to intensify. Related issues: [#306](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/issues/306), [#1104](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/issues/1104).

From the technical perspective, it's a good idea to provide auto-scaler capability because the auto-scaler of inference workloads dynamically adjusts the number of inference instances based on request volumeâ€”scaling up during traffic spikes to improve inference speed, and scaling down during low demand to minimize GPU resource waste. Furthermore, for workloads with predictable, recurring traffic patterns, a time-based scaler can proactively adjust capacity, ensuring resources are ready before they are needed.

The auto-scaler solution for Kaito should be shown as follows:

![auto-scaler](../../static/img/workspace-scale-api.png)

We will divide this auto-scaler feature into two parts as follows:

- Part one: support scale subresource API for workspace, so different auto-scaler solutions such as KEDA, HPA, etc. can be integrated with Kaito to manage inference workloads dynamically. This part is addressed in another proposal: https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/pull/1184.
- Part two: support a customized auto-scaler for Kaito. The auto-scaler is designed for a minimalistic configuration experience, with most parameters pre-tuned for optimal performance. This allows users to easily get started without requiring specialized knowledge of LLM. This part will be addressed in this proposal. We name this auto-scaler as llm-auto-scaler, which will support both reactive (metric-based) and proactive (time-based) scaling.

To ensure ease of use, the specialized auto-scaler is hosted in an independent repo (kaito-project/llm-auto-scaler). At the same time, the llm-auto-scaler component can work with Kaito without depending on any third-party components.

### Goals

- llm-auto-scaler is a specialized auto-scaler for scaling gpu workloads automatically, and can integrate with kaito to work.
- It is flexible enough to support multiple scalers. This proposal introduces two primary scalers: a metric-based scaler for reactive scaling and a cron-based scaler for proactive, scheduled scaling.

### Non-Goals/Future Work

- The time efficiency of the auto-scaler is not within the scope of this proposal, as it is influenced by mutliple external factors, including GPU node provisioning, LLM image pulling, etc.
- Only support scale vllm workload, and non-vllm is not covered.

## Proposal

### LLM-Auto-Scaler Architecture

The llm-auto-scaler component determines the desired number of replicas based on the configured scaling strategy in the `LLMAutoScaler` CRD. For metric-based scaling, it scrapes metrics from the inference pods. For time-based scaling, it evaluates cron schedules. The scaler controller then calculates the desired replica count and scales the workspace replicas through the `/scale` subresource API. The detailed auto-scaler architecture is shown in the following figure:

![auto-scaler](../../static/img/llm-auto-scaler.png)

- **LLMAutoScaler CRD**: Defines the auto-scaler configuration, including the scaling strategy (metric-based or time-based), target resource, and scaling parameters.
- **Metrics Scraper**: A module of the llm-auto-scaler used for scraping metrics from inference pods. This component is active only when a `RealtimeScaler` (metric-based) strategy is configured.
- **Multiple Scalers**: The proposal supports two primary scaling strategies: `RealtimeScaler` for reactive scaling based on metrics, and `CronScaler` for proactive scaling based on a predefined schedule. These scalers determine the algorithm used to calculate the desired number of replicas.
- **Scaler Controller**: The core logic that integrates the selected scale strategy (either with scraped metrics or cron schedules) to calculate the desired replicas and invokes the `/scale` subresource API of the target workspace.

### Realtime Scaler

#### Metrics Scraper

- Metrics Scraper fetches specified metrics from pods' /metrics endpoint according to `LLMAutoScaler.Spec.Scaler.Realtime.Metrics` at a 15s interval.
- For each metric in the `Metrics` list, the scraper will:
    - Construct the endpoint URL: `metric.Source.Protocol://{pod ip}:metric.Source.Port/metric.Source.Path`. The default is `http://{pod ip}:5000/metrics`.
    - Get pod IPs from the pods referenced by `InferenceAutoScaler.Spec.ScaleTargetRef`.
    - Resolve the metric value from the response using `metric.Source.Name`. The default metric name is `vllm:num_requests_waiting`.
- If multiple pods are selected, the average metric value will be calculated for each metric.
- If a metric cannot be resolved from a pod (e.g., the pod is pending), the average value will be calculated using the following rules to prevent flapping:
  - In the scale-up direction: use 0 as the metric value for missing pods.
  - In the scale-down direction: use the metric's `High` threshold as the value for missing pods.

#### Scaler Rule

The realtime scaler is used to scale GPU workloads according to specified metric changes. it means that realtime scaler is a passive scaling. 
and the scaling rules will be integrated to calculate desired replicas.


| item | scale up(default value) | scale down(default value) | introduication |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| scale stepÂ Â Â  | 1Â Â  | 1Â Â  | Â only increase/reduce one replica in a scaling action, because the cost of gpu resource is really highÂ |
| cooldown secondsÂ Â Â  | 600Â Â  | 1800Â Â  | a waiting period after a scaling action for preventing frequent scaling |
| stablizationwindow secondsÂ Â Â  | 30Â Â  | 300Â Â  | a lookback window that delays scaling decisions for avoiding premature scaling. and we hope scale-up to respond more quickly, while scale-down should occur more slowly. It means that scale-up is triggered only when the metric value exceeds the high threshold in 2 consecutive periods. and scale-down is triggered only when the metric value less than low threshold in 20 consecutive periods |

	// Iterate over all metrics and calculate the desired replicas for each.
	// The final desired replicas will be the maximum of all calculations.
	for _, metric := range AllMetrics {
		// The logic inside calculateReplicasForMetric is the same as the previous single-metric pseudocode.

		metricDesiredReplicas := calculateReplicasForMetric(metric, CurrentReplicas, INPUTS)
		if metricDesiredReplicas > desiredReplicas {
			desiredReplicas = metricDesiredReplicas
		}
	}

	return desiredReplicas
}

		if DownStabilizationWindowSeconds > 0 {
			windowMetrics := filterMetricsWithinWindow(LLMAutoScaler.Name + metric.Name, MetricsHistory, DownStabilizationWindowSeconds)
			maxInWindow := max(windowMetrics)
			if maxInWindow >= metric.Threshold.Low {
				// there is a metric value above low threshold, so skip scale down

### Cron Scaler

The Cron Scaler provides a proactive, time-based scaling mechanism that adjusts the number of replicas at scheduled times. Unlike the Realtime Scaler, which reacts to metric changes, the Cron Scaler allows you to align resource allocation with predictable traffic patterns, such as scaling up before business hours and scaling down during nights or weekends. This approach ensures that capacity is available before demand spikes, improving responsiveness and user experience.

Each cron policy defines a `schedule` in standard cron format and a `targetReplicas` count. The autoscaler will continuously monitor the clock and, when the current time matches a policy's schedule, it will adjust the workload's replica count to the specified target.

- Take the following policies as an example:

```yaml
policies:
  # The "scale-up" policy increases the number of replicas to 5 at 8:00 AM every day
  # to handle peak traffic during business hours.
  - name: "scale-up"
    schedule: "0 8 * * *" # Cron schedule for 8:00 AM daily
    targetReplicas: 5
    timeZone: "America/New_York" # Uses Eastern Time
  # The "scale-down" policy reduces the number of replicas to 1 at 1 minute past midnight (00:01)
  # every day to conserve resources during off-peak hours.
  - name: "scale-down"
    schedule: "1 0 * * *" # Cron schedule for 00:01 AM daily
    targetReplicas: 1
    timeZone: "America/New_York" # Uses Eastern Time
```

The `scale-up` policy will scale the number of replicas to 5 at 08:00 every day in the `America/New_York` timezone, and the `scale-down` policy will scale the number of replicas to 1 at 00:01 every day in the `America/New_York` timezone.

**TimeZone Support**: The `timeZone` field allows you to specify the timezone for interpreting the cron schedule. This is particularly useful for aligning scaling actions with business hours in specific geographic regions. The timezone must be a valid IANA Time Zone identifier (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/London", "Asia/Shanghai"). If not specified, it defaults to "Etc/UTC". More information can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

#### Cron Scaler Pseudocode

Inputs:

- CurrentReplicas: Actual number of replicas for the target workload.
- CronPolicies: The list of cron policies defined in `LLMAutoScaler.Spec.Scaler.Cron.Policies`.
- MinReplicas: The minimum number of replicas for the target object.
- MaxReplicas: The maximum number of replicas for the target object.

Outputs:

- DesiredReplicas: Desired number of replicas for the target workload.

```go
import (
	"time"
	"github.com/robfig/cron/v3"
)

func calculateDesiredReplicasCron(INPUTS) OUTPUTS {
	var matchingReplicas []int32

	// Find all policies that match the current time
	for _, policy := range CronPolicies {
		location, err := time.LoadLocation(policy.TimeZone)
		if err != nil {
			location = time.UTC
		}
		nowInLocation := time.Now().In(location)

		schedule, err := cron.ParseStandard(policy.Schedule)
		if err != nil {
			continue
		}

		// Check if the last run was within the last minute, considering the policy's timezone
		lastRun := schedule.Next(nowInLocation.Add(-time.Minute))
		if nowInLocation.Truncate(time.Minute).Equal(lastRun.Truncate(time.Minute)) {
			matchingReplicas = append(matchingReplicas, policy.TargetReplicas)
		}
	}

	// If no policy matches, no change in replicas
	if len(matchingReplicas) == 0 {
		return CurrentReplicas
	}

	// If multiple policies match, pick the one with the highest replica count
	// to ensure capacity for the highest-demand schedule.
	desired := matchingReplicas[0]
	for i := 1; i < len(matchingReplicas); i++ {
		if matchingReplicas[i] > desired {
			desired = matchingReplicas[i]
		}
	}

	// Clamp the desired replicas within the min/max boundaries
	if desired < MinReplicas {
		desired = MinReplicas
	}
	if desired > MaxReplicas {
		desired = MaxReplicas
	}

	return desired
}
```

## Alternatives

### Justification for LLMAutoScaler

While HPA provides a solid foundation and KEDA offers powerful, general-purpose event-driven scaling, a specialized `LLMAutoScaler` is justified for the Kaito ecosystem for the following reasons:

1.  **Simplified User Experience**: The primary goal is to offer an extremely simple autoscaling solution for Kaito users. `LLMAutoScaler` achieves this by embedding domain knowledge (e.g., knowing how to scrape VLLM's waiting request metric by default) and providing pre-tuned, sensible defaults. This reduces a potentially complex setup to a few declarative fields in a CRD.

2.  **Reduced Operational Overhead**: The cost and complexity of deploying and maintaining a full Prometheus stack just for autoscaling a few inference services is prohibitive. The zero-dependency, built-in metrics scraper of `LLMAutoScaler` makes it lightweight, easy to adopt, and significantly cheaper to operate.

3.  **Optimized for GPU Scaling**: GPU resources are expensive, and their scaling behavior must be managed carefully to balance cost and performance. A generic scaling algorithm may scale up and down too frequently ("flapping"), incurring high costs. `LLMAutoScaler`'s custom algorithm, with its distinct stabilization windows and cooldowns for scaling up versus down, provides the necessary fine-grained control to prevent premature or overly aggressive scaling actions.

In conclusion, while KEDA and HPA are excellent tools for general-purpose autoscaling, the `LLMAutoScaler` is designed to be a superior solution *specifically for LLM inference workloads within Kaito*, prioritizing ease of use, low operational overhead, and optimized performance for its target use case.
